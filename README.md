//Collaboration and sources
//The unsorted linked list, sorted linked list, and sorted vector list were all of my own work, I used resources like geeksforgeeks to help me create binary search and what structure I needed in order to make it work
// properly. I did use chat gpt periodically to test my code and used some code suggestions that helped improve my work. Especially when I was tired and couldn't remember all of the base cases but I knew they were \
//missing. I adapted these examples to my own code by creating my own values, using my own logic for the while loops, and continous testing. However, while I was trying to update my filezilla tonight with the new edits I made, I accidentally overwrote my original, so currently I am unsure if it works lol.

//Implementation details
//The structures I used were sorted and unsorted Linked lists, as well as a sorted vector. The algorithms I came up with used iterative behaviors, as I used many while loops to continously check if the linked list
//s were reaching nullptr. I used a combination of algorithms in all of the operations, such as binary searching, linear search, and O(n)/ O(logn) behaviors in lookup. In remove and insert, especially when it came to the sorted vectors, binary search was crucial. I also chose for the unsorted linked list for inserting and removing to use FIFO, it was just much easier to manipulate than if it was put in either middle or the tail. 

//Testing status

Currently, the program does work on Clion, I also know that my sorted and unsorted linked lists work properly. However, when it comes to my sorted vector list I do not know due to the crashing of my filezilla. I unfortunately also forgot to write the remove run times in my output as well. I know that the sorted and unsorted linked lists work because I used blue as a way to test, and there were some run time errors and memory leaks found at first. However, after testing it (before crashing file zilla) I am confident that they work.
